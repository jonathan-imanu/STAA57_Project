# STAA57_Project

## PS

I use git with Rstudio datatools by going to File then new_projects and cloning 
the repo.

If you have trouble, make sure you do the initial git config stuff.

When pushing files (I suggest doing this using the Git icon located on the below 
the file bar), GitHub asks for your username and password. 

Your user name 
is your regular github user name but the password is a [PAT](https://forum.posit.co/t/pushing-to-github-requests-password-but-actually-needs-personal-access-token-pat/156610). 

To create a PAT in github follow these steps:

From your GitHub account, go to Settings → Developer Settings → 
Personal Access Token → Tokens (classic) → 
Generate New Token (Give your password) → Fillup the form → click Generate token 
→ Copy the generated Token, it will be something like 
ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta
