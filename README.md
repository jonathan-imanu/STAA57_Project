# Water Quality of Ontario's Inland Lakes

Check it out: <a href="docs/report.pdf" target="_blank">Report</a>

## Introduction 

This report relies on four data sets sourced from the Ontario Lake Partner 
Program (LPP) via the Ontario Data Catalog. The LPP conducts annual assessments 
of water quality in inland lakes throughout Ontario, with data collected by 
volunteers following standardized provincial protocols. Specifically, the 
data sets cover total phosphorus, calcium, chloride concentration, and water 
clarity for numerous inland lakes, predominantly situated in the Precambrian 
Shield region. Each data set includes geographical coordinates, site descriptions, 
collection dates, and metrics pertaining to the water quality.

## Purpose 

This report aims to address the research question: 

How has the water quality of Ontario’s inland lakes, as measured by total phosphorus, 
calcium, chloride concentration, and water clarity, changed from 2015 to 2022? 
What does this suggest about the productivity of Ontario’s inland lakes?
